          Blood donation requirements are put in place to ensure the safety of
          both the donor and the recipient of the blood. While specific
          guidelines may slightly vary depending on the country and blood bank,
          there are some common criteria that donors generally need to meet:
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          <Text style={styles.text2}>1.Age:</Text>Donors are typically required
          to be within a certain age range, often between 18 to 65 years old.
          Some places may have variations in this range.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          <Text style={styles.text2}>2.Weight:</Text>Donors usually need to
          weigh at least a certain amount to ensure they can safely donate
          without adversely affecting their health. This criterion helps prevent
          adverse effects like dizziness or weakness after donation.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          <Text style={styles.text2}>3.Health:</Text>Donors must be in good
          health on the day of donation. They should not have any acute or
          chronic illnesses, infections, or conditions that might pose a risk to
          either the donor or the recipient.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          <Text style={styles.text2}>4.Travel History:</Text>Some locations have
          restrictions based on recent travel history to certain regions or
          countries known for diseases like malaria or other infections. Travel
          to areas with endemic diseases might lead to temporary deferral from
          donating blood.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          <Text style={styles.text2}>5.Medications:</Text>Certain medications
          may also affect eligibility for blood donation. Some medications might
          require a waiting period before a person can donate blood.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          <Text style={styles.text2}>6.Lifestyle Factors:</Text>Individuals
          engaging in high-risk behaviors like intravenous drug use or
          unprotected sex may have restrictions or deferrals from donating blood
          due to an increased risk of infections like HIV or hepatitis.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          <Text style={styles.text2}>7.Previous Donations:</Text>There is
          usually a specific interval required between donations to ensure the
          donor’s body has adequate time to replenish the lost blood components.
          This interval typically ranges from 8 to 12 weeks between whole blood
          donations.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Before donating blood, potential donors usually undergo a screening
          process that involves a brief health questionnaire and sometimes a
          mini-physical examination to ensure they meet these criteria. It’s
          important to be honest during the screening process to ensure the
          safety of both the donor and the recipient.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          These requirements are set to maintain the safety and integrity of the
          blood supply and to protect the health of both donors and recipients.
          If someone is interested in donating blood, it’s advisable to check
          with local blood donation centers or organizations to understand
          specific eligibility criteria and ensure they meet the necessary
          requirements.
